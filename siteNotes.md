Landing page text
  - YAML info on index site

Reference URLs for social links
  - config.yml file


Footer copyright and credit info
  - config.yml file

Landing page image
  - in landing page css file under .image-header

Defaults set in landing-page.css
Default font can be controlled inside <section class="content-section" ...> tag

Outstanding issues:
  - Panel heading height (changing height results in panel heading text no longer vertically aligning with panel heading)
  - Placing a footer that will allow the full background image to be extended above it and will stay at the bottom of the page with scrolling and panel opening
  - Only one Rmarkdon HTML
